      <h5>11:CIRCUITS</h5>
      
      <p>This week, I had more time to figure out the specifics for my <a href="../15_week_15/index.html" target="_blank">final project</a>. After exchanging some emails with Jim and talking with Rob, I decided to go with the (initially not-as-satisfying) solution of just having a servo motor at the end of my circuit controlling the knob on an analog pedal.<br>
      Given the constraints right now, my goal is to have a working version of this with 1-2 MIDI pedals and 1-2 motors.</p>
      <p>—I don't actually own more than one MIDI expression pedal, though, so the other input device will likely be a MIDI cue pedal posing for one or acting as a trigger that turns the analog pedal on and off.—</p>

      <p>Additionally, some compatibility issues between my computer (using Catalina on a MacBook) and some of the boards have made me decide to work only with the Arduino boards I have. This has proven much more reliable just in terms of board recognition and compliling, so it seems like a practical solution for now. Besides the UNO, I have repurposed an Arduino Mega a friend had lent me to control something I'm not using anymore.<br>
      So, I will be working with a MIDI expression pedal (essentially as a potentiometer) with an Arduino UNO at the input end, connecting via radio with our nRF24L01's to an Arduino Mega at the output end to control a servo.<br>
      Here is a CAD model of the most simple version of this circuit:</p>

      <p><img src="./cad-1.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="A CAD model of the circuit">
      </p>

      <p>Although I had already kind of achieved something very similar to this using different boards in the past (see weeks 9-10) as a prototype for what became a failed attempt at the project I had initially planned, I have been having a little trouble getting the two boards to communicate between each other in the day or two since I decided to switch boards for the Mega.*<br>
      So far, it looks like this issue might be attributed to <a href="https://github.com/nRF24/RF24/issues/24" target="_blank">this</a> particularity of the RF24 library with the Mega, which I am hoping shouldn't be too hard to solve.</p>

      <p>It should be stated that one of the other reasons for using a Mega for all this is the future potential of hooking this up to many more servos to control many more pedals. This is partly why I am insisting on the Mega.</p>

      <p>As for the way I am currently thinking of connecting the servo with the knob on the analog pedal, right now I just took one of the wings and cut it to leave only the little piece that goes into the motor's built-in screw, superglued that to a knob, placed that knob on the pot at the pedal, and tried holding the servo using helping hands for soldering, like this:</p>

      <p><img src="./IMG_6265.JPG" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:50%" alt="The DIY servo/pedal connection">
      </p>

      <p>In the future, if we regain access to the lab, it would be cool to put together a chassis that can hold several servos using maybe scrap metal lying around, kind of like the inverse of a guitar pedal board that would look down and connect to different knobs on different pedals. That, of course, will for now be just a possible future enhancement to the project.</p>

      <p>One thing that is left for me to solve at this point and may seem like a minor problem, but which has been troubling me in the past few days, is that I want this to be something that can work in a quiet environment. I mean, I want to be able to hook up these pedals to instruments that aren't necessarily very heavily amplified and the servos themselves make quite a bit of noise. I assume this will be a problem with all geared motors, but if anyone knows of specific models that are designed to be silent or super quiet, that would be great to know!<br>
      Again, this isn't really something to solve for right now, but it would be good to know for the future, when I actually want to implement this and use it in a concert (when we can have concerts again! :'( ).</p>
