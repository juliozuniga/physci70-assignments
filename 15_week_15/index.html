		<h4>Some ideas for my final project:</h4>

		<p>1. In the past few months, I have been assembling 500-series pre-amps for my audio "lunchbox." Although the DIY kits you can <a href='https://www.diyrecordingequipment.com' target="_blank">get online</a> can be of very good quality and really fun to put together, i would like to see if i can design and build a couple of modules from scratch myself.<br>It would be amazing to build a vocoder, but unfortunately a <a href='https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-an-analog-vocoder/' target="_blank">quick search</a> makes it seem like it's probably too much to pack in a 500-series module. A good preamp with an integrated EQ could be a good alternative!</p>

		<p>2. Another interesting project would be to build small, clip-on microphones with their own integrated effects circuits for live amplification and processing of acoustic instruments.</p>
