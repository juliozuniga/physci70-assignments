		<h5>FINAL PROJECT IDEAS</h5>

		<p><font color="#8c8c8c">1. In the past few months, I have been assembling 500-series pre-amps for my audio "lunchbox." Although the DIY kits you can <a href='https://www.diyrecordingequipment.com' target="_blank">get online</a> can be of very good quality and really fun to put together, i would like to see if i can design and build a couple of modules from scratch myself.<br>It would be amazing to build a vocoder, but unfortunately a <a href='https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-an-analog-vocoder/' target="_blank">quick search</a> makes it seem like it's probably too much to pack in a 500-series module. A good preamp with an integrated EQ could be a good alternative!</font></p>

		<p><font color="#8c8c8c">2. Another interesting project would be to build small, clip-on microphones and a couple of dedicated effects pedals for them, for live amplification and processing of acoustic instruments.</font></p>

		<p><b>20200416--UPDATE:</b></p>

		<p>The lockdown-friendly final project will be closer to what I described in my work for week 10: <a href='../10_week_10/index.html' target="_blank">a MIDI/analog audio communication system</a>. After more tests, I think some additional materials I would need are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>3m red and black wire</li>
			<li>2m yellow and x color wire</li>
			<li>a heat gun</li>
			<li>heat shrink tubing, 3 and 6mm</li>
			<li>2-4 protoboards</li>
		</ul>

		<p><hr></p>
		<p>Still TBD is whether I need to amplify the DAC 0-3.3V signal from the ESP32 to 0-9V<br>
		but will probably need to build a voltage-controlled resistor to act as the variable resistance of the potentiometer pin on the original fuzz? (Will discuss with TFs further but see picture below.)</p>

		<p>Another option is to see if I can get a digipot, but I think I'd rather try to solve it ^this way.</p>
